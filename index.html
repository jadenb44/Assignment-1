    <h2>10% Happier</h2>
    <h3>by Dan Harris</h3>
    <h3 class="Summary">Summary :</h3>
    <p>Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier.
        Being mindful doesnâ€™t change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help 
        you respond to your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize 
        that striving for success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside 
        your control.</p>

        <h2>The 10x Rule</h2>
        <h3>by Grant Cardone</h3>
        <h3 class="Summary">Summary :</h3>
        <p>The 10X Rule says that 1) you should set targets for yourself that are 10X greater 
            than what you believe you can achieve and 2) you should take actions that are 10X 
            greater than what you believe are necessary to achieve your goals. The biggest 
            mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. Taking massive 
            action is the only way to fulfill your true potential.</p>

        <h2>A Short Guide to a Happy Life</h2>
        <h3>by Anna Quindlen</h3>
        <h3 class="Summary">Summary :</h3>
        <p>The only thing you have that nobody else has is control of your life. The hardest 
            thing of all is to learn to love the journey, not the destination. Get a real life 
            rather than frantically chasing the next level of success.</p>
